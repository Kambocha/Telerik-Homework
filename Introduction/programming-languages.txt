C is one of the most widely used programming languages of all time, and C compilers are available for the majority of available computer architectures and operating systems.

Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

Objective-C was originally developed in the early 1980s. It was selected as the main language used by NeXT for its NeXTSTEP operating system, from which OS X and iOS are derived.

C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing the facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

Most of these programming language were developed in the same manner and have most things in common from the syntax point of view.
